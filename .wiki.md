# Project Summary
ScoutTalent is an AI-powered football talent marketplace aimed at connecting African youth players with global scouts. The platform enhances player visibility through a modern web application, allowing athletes to manage profiles, upload videos, and interact with scouts. The project has evolved into a monorepo structure, integrating backend microservices and a responsive frontend application.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of the following functional modules:
- **Auth Service**: Manages user registration, authentication, and role management.
- **Profile Service**: Handles player and scout profiles, including details and trust levels.
- **Media Service**: Facilitates video uploads and metadata management.
- **AI Moderation Worker**: Analyzes content using AI for moderation purposes.
- **Discovery Service**: Enables searching and recommending profiles and videos.
